Judgingclass
============

The judgingclass is the class containing the judgment rules: how much points
a forecast gets given the forecasted and observed values.
As these rules might change over time the judgingclass can be defined within
the :doc:`Configfile <configfile>`.

.. note:: This here is the example of the judingclass20021206 containing
    the rules as used since 2002-12-06 on `Wetterturnier.de <http://www.wetterturnier.de>`_.
